any propery that can change on the gui elements themselves due to other means
such as the user toggling a switch or writing in a text field cause problems
because updating the state to reflect the change will also cause calling of
the dynamic value setter function of that property which is not only redundant
but it can also cause flickering in multiplayer with latency, or maybe even in
singleplayer

it's just bad, alright.
